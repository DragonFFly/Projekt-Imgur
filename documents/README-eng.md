Prvi projekt RO-P, Imgur -Tilen Krajnc

This webpage works as a wep app, that shows the user its posts with in a grid, which can be uploaded by all users with different tags .
The posts may have multiple images and they each have their own comments, which can be posted by any user on whichever post.
The posts and comments use the karma system (upvote & downvote), which means users can vote on posts and comments whether they like them or not, and the users that uploaded them get points to their account.
Every user can update their account by changing their profile pic, email, password and name.
Users can search through posts, tags and other users through the search field on each page.
